          <h1>Self Paced Reading Example: Defining Sentence Regions</h1>
          <p>
            Sometimes we aim to test predictions about the total reading times of
            sentences (or the speed or accuracy of answers to comprehension
            questions following the sentences). Most of the time though, research
            on sentence processing is interested in differences in reading speeds (and
            thus reading times) between conditions at <em>specific</em> points in
            the critical items.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, the example hypothesis that led to the 2x2 design
            described in the previous sections (repeated in Figure 1 below),
            would lead us to predict differences in reading speeds on the
            target word (hence the name "target word") based on the contextual
            predictability and frequency of the target word ("apple" or "kiwi").
            These differences might show up on the target word itself or
            <a href="Glossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Often in self-paced reading studies differences in reading times can happen both on the sentence regions that are experimentally manipulated as well as several words later. For example, in a garden path sentence, reading times can slow down both at the disambiguating word and a few words after.">spill over</a>
            onto the next words.
          </p>

          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>
            Beyond the target word and the spill-over region, we wouldn't expect
            the reading times to differ between the four conditions on any of the
            other regions of the sentence.

          <h2>Region-by-region reading times</h2>
          <p>
            To allow reseachers to test fine-grained predictions about differences
            in reading times at different points in the sentence, CrowdExp-SPR
            records word-by-word reading times. For analysis, these word-by-word
            reading times will often be collapsed into region-by-region reading
            times. This region-by-region averaging makes the reading time estimates
            more reliable (since each data point for the analysis will be based
            on more observations). Sometimes, though, regions consist of just one word.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, for the example design discussed above we might decide
            to define two sentence regions, the target word ("apple/kiwi") and
            a two-word spill-over region ("on the"). This definition would apply
            across critical items. For example, we wouldn't usually have some
            critical items with two-word spill-over regions and some critical
            items with three-word spill-over regions. Additionally, the
            <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">critical region</a>
            should ideally be held constant across the conditions of an item.
            Later we will learn more about
            <a href="SPRFormat.html">how to define sentence regions for
              CrowdExp-SPR</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sentence regions are something that we usually only worry about for
            the critical items. While we <em>can</em> define sentence regions for
            filler items as well, we usually have no predictions for how filler items
            will be read, and thus no reason to define sentence regions for filler
            items.
