        <h1>Self Paced Reading Analysis</h1>
          <p>
            This guide will help you understand the SPR report you received with
            your data. The report outlines what we did to clean up the data and how
            much data was excluded in the process of cleaning, a calculation of
            the mean question accuracy from your experiment, an analysis of the
            accuracy by condition to see if some of your conditions had different
            accuracy as compared to others, and finally an analysis of the residual
            reading times for each region of interest.
          </p>
        <h3>An example report</h3>
          <p>
            The raw reading data has been cleaned with the following steps:
            * Participants were removed for having question accuracy lower than 80%
            * Reading times were removed if the reading times were shorter than 100 msec or longer than 2000 msec
            * Reading times were removed if they were 3 standard deviations away from the mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is summary of exclusions.

            <br>
            The mean question accuracy was 95.690547.
            The following table shows accuracy by condition.
            Significance markers means that condition has a different
            accuracy as compared to the baseline condition.

            <br/>
            Reading times were residualized by word length and participant.
            A model was fit analyzing residual reading times based on condition.
            This table is a summary of each model. Significance markers means that
            residual RTs differ for specific conditions as compared to the baseline
            condition.

          <h1>Example Walkthrough</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Exclusions</b> We always clean our data to remove points that might
            not be valid. The first thing we do is remove participants who have a low
            question accuracy because that suggests that particular participant was
            not paying attention and their data is likely not valid. Second we eliminate
            reading times that are less than 100 msec, which is unrealistically short and
            likely means the participant didn't read the word (either by accidental
            button press or on purpose). We also eliminate reading times that are
            greater than 2000 msec (2 seconds) as those are too long. Finally we
            eliminate reading times that fall 3 standard deviations away from the mean.
            When we report data we must always report these steps as well as how much
            data is lost at each step.
          </p>

        <p>
          <b>Region Ordering</b> We rank ordered the region if possible so that
          their order is equivalent to positions in the sentence. If it was not
          possible to rank order the regions (either because orders differed across
          items) your report will say so and the regions will show up in a more or
          less random order. Make sure to pay attention to this when you interpret
          your findings.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Accuracy</b> We first report overall accuracy for both items and
          fillers. We then remove the fillers and look at accuracy for the items
          alone and specifically we look to see if there is a difference in accuracy
          across our conditions. Typically we do not want there to be differences
          across conditions and if there are differences we need to report them.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Accuracy by condition report</b> We test for significant differences
          in accuracy by running a logistic Mixed Effects regression. We test for
          effects of condition on accuracy. There are multiple ways to do this and
          for simplicity we do this by setting one of your conditions as the baseline
          (labeled Constant) and seeing if each condition is different from that baseline
          (this is referred to as treatment or dummy coding). This does not mean
          you will be able to know if two non-baseline conditions differ
          from each other so interpret the report carefully.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the example above we see that the baseline condition has a significant
          effect (note the little *'s). This means that accuracy for the baseline
          condition was greater than 0 with p &lt; 0.001. The next row shows that
          Condition R does not have a significant effect (note that there are no *'s),
          meaning there is no difference in accuracy between the baseline and Condition
          R. That is, both conditions had the same overall accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Residual Reading times</b> The first step to analyzing reading times
          is to remove effects for word length. That is, we normalize the time it
          took to read the word for the length of the word. This process is called
          residualization. After that we calculate the mean reading time for each
          region instead of analyzing each word within a region individually.
          Then we center the reading times (subtract the mean reading time from
          all values). Finally we test for effects of Condition on residual
          reading times for each region using a mixed effects linear regression
          model.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the example above there are four regions. We were able to order
          the regions based on how they appeared in the sentence. As above we
          first see if the baseline condition had an effect (labeled Constant).
          We see no difference in residual RTs for any of the regions. Since our
          residual RTs were centered that means in none of the regions did the
          residual RT in the baseline condition differ from the mean residual
          RT of that region.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the next row we see one significant effect, the reading times for
          the preposition region differed for sentences in condition R. There is
          a negative effect meaning that residual RTs in condition R were shorter
          than in the baseline condition.
        </p>

        <p>
          For at least some groups there were regions that had little data. Our
          analyses can only work with a certain amount of data and if that criteria
          is not met than region analysis is not reported. Make sure to pay
          attention to whether all your regions are reported and if not be aware
          it is because we could not conduct analyses on those missing regions
          (and hence we can't draw any conclusions about them).
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>The plot</b> We include a plot for each group. Regions are ordered
          left to right (if we could order your regions). For each region the
          residual RTs for each condition is shown. We present the by-participant
          and by-condition aggregated data, meaning we plot the average residual
          RTs for each participant for each condition. We do this as it better
          approximates how we analyze the data (though not completely, more on
          that below). These participant aggregate residual reading times are
          plotted as faint dots on the plot. We also show error bars that represent
          95% confidence intervals (CIs). Finally we plot lines that connect the
          mean residual RTs for each group (if we couldn't order your regions we
          didn't add lines).
        </p>

        <p>
          Plotting our data gives us a different way to understand what is
          happening compared to the analyses in the report. From the plot we can
          see that residual RTs on the preposition region are generally longer
          than the other regions. Though, we would want to do an analysis to see
          if that was a statistically significant effect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our analyses showed that residual RTs differed between the conditions
          on the preposition region. Specifically the results suggested that
          residual RTs for Condition R were shorter than in the other condition.
          Looking at the plot we can see that the residual RTs for Condition R
          are shorter. While the CIs overlap on the plot (which would normally
          suggest a non-significant difference) our analyses confirm that the
          two conditions do differ. Why the plot suggests a slightly different
          result is partly due to our aggregation of the data by-participant and
          condition. Our analyses control for individual differences between
          participants and items by estimating differences them rather than
          controlling for these differences by averaging them out. This allows
          for more powerful testing and hence why we might we can find significant
          statistical differences despite somewhat weak visualized differences
          (see this wiki page for more info about this). The upshot of this is you
          need to both look at your data and your analyses to get a complete
          picture of your results.
