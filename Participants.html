            Another important design decision is <em>what type</em> of participant
            and <em>how many</em>
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The people who participate in a study (sometimes called subjects).">participants</a>
            your experiment should have.
          </p>

        <h2>Type of participants</h2>
          <p>
            The type of participant you should administer depends on the
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title=" The complete group of items we are interested in.">population</a>
            your hypothesis is about. When we run participants, we assume that
            these participants are independently sampled from the population.
            This is a critical assumption, because we want the participants to
            be <em>representative</em> for the population. It is because of this
            assumption that we feel we can take the results of our experiments
            as evidence of the likelihood that our hypothesis holds
            for the population of interest. To continue the example from above,
            we might hypothesize that any healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems reads high-frequency words more quickly than
            low-frequency words. In that case "healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems" would be our population.
          </p>
          <p id="numb">
            Note that we often make simplifying assumptions in selecting our
            participants. For example, college students are most likely <em>not</em>
            a representative example of the average "healthy native speaker of English
            without reading problems". Yet, it is commonly accepted to generalize
            from college student participants to the larger population of English
            speakers.

        <h2>Number of participants</h2>
          <p>Think about it: Why aren't we just administering a single participant for
            our experiment? You probably have the intuition that this would be problematic.
            For one thing, there's only so much data we can get from one participant
            before that person gets tired or bored (and starts providing less and less
            reliable data). But you probably also have the intuition that there's another
            reason beyond this. Even if we had thousands of data points from a single
            participants, we might wonder whether it is just something idiosyncratic
            about that participant that gives us those results. For example, what if
            that one participant--despite our best efforts to screen for it--has some
            form of dyslexia or other deficits that will affect how that participant
            reads? In that case, the participant would not be representative of our
            target population. This problem of representativeness is arguably particularly
            severe for experiments on aspects of higher-level cognition (including
            language), because there's more individual variation with regard to those
            aspects of cognition.
          </p>

          <p>
            So, we typically want to administer quite a few participants, in order
            to feel confident that our results will generalize to the population of
            interest. But how many participants is enough?
            On the one hand, more participants cost more
            money and it can also take longer to recruit them, delaying the completion
            of your experiment. On the other hand, more participants make it more likely
            that we obtain
            <a href="Glossary.html#R" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">reliable results</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            One important distinction is between the overall number of participants
            you plan to administer and the number of
            <a href="Glossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title=" A participants who is included in an analysis of an experiment. I.e. completed the experimental task and was not excluded based on a priori exclusion criteria.">successful participants</a>
            you plan to administer. As we will discuss later, we sometimes have to exclude
            participants from the analysis. This could happen, for example, because there
            was a technical problem and no responses were recorded from them. Or the participant
            fails to meet <i>a priori</i> defined
            <a href="Glossary.html#I" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">inclusion-criteria</a>.
            It is the number of <em>successful</em> participants that determines how reliable
            your results will be.
          </p>

          <p>
            How many participants we should enroll in an experiment is often a
            complicated question. But there are rules of thumb. First, if you are
            conducting an experiment that is very similar to previous experiments,
            have a look at how many participants these experiments employed. Also
            ask yourself whether those experiments obtained reliable results: Were
            there results clearly significant (or just barely significant)? Were
            there several studies and did they all replicate
            the significant result with approximately the same number of participants?
            If previous work suggests that the effect is somewhat unreliable (e.g.,
            if previous work always reports significance values <em>just</em> below
            p &lt; .05), you might want to plan to administer more participants than
            previous work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending how comfortable you are with statistics, you can also run
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Statistical analysis that lets us determine how big of a sample size we need to detect an effect with a certain confidence.">power simulations</a>,
            in which you assess how likely you would be to
            find an effect under certain assumptions about the size of the hypothesized
            effect (based on previous experiments).
          </p>

          <p>
            Regardless of how you decide how many participants to administer for
            your experiment, the most important thing is that you make this decision
            <em>before you start collecting data</em>. If you start to run you experiment
            and then decide later to add further participants, then you risk biasing
            your results.
