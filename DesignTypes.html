          <p id="within">There are many types of experimental designs. Choosing the most
            appropriate design depends on your hypotheses and the nature of the
            independent variables.</p>

            <h2>Within-Participant Designs</h2>
              <p>In a within-participant design, all predictor variables are
                manipulated within participants, so that every participant is
                exposed to every condition of the experiment.</p>

              <p>Consider the by-2 design described above, manipulating
                word frequency. As already described, there would be two conditions:
                high-frequency vs. low-frequency.
                For a within-participant design, each participant would respond to
                both high- and low- frequency words.</p>

              <p id="between">One of the benefits
                of a within-participant design is that you can measure the effect of
                experimental conditions on performance, while accounting for individual
                differences between participants (e.g., measuring the difference in
                reading times for high- and low-frequency words while
                accounting for the fact that people vary in their baseline reading speech).</p>

            <h2>Between-participant Design</h2>
              <p>In a between-participant design, all predictor variables are
                manipulated between participants. That is, each participant is only
                exposed to a subset of the experimental conditions, possibly just one
                condition.</p>

              <p>For our example, one group of participants would see only high-frequency
                words, whereas another group of participants would see only low-frequency
                words.</p>

             <p>Note that, the same number of participants in a between-participant
               design provideless statistical power to detect an effect than in a
               within-participant design. There's an intuitive reason behind this:
               in a between-participant design, any difference that is caused by the
               design manipulation (e.g., high- vs. low-frequency words) now needs to
               have an effect <em>over and above individual differences between
               participants</em>. This means that the effect of the manipulation
               will be harder to detect.</p>

               <p>However, a between-participant design is sometimes inevitable,
                 for example, when your hypothesis (and thus the predictor variables) involves
                 properties of the participants that vary across individuals (e.g.,
                 monolinguals vs. bilinguals; children vs. adults; fast readers vs.
                 slow readers). In other cases, a within-participant design is logically
                 possible, but a between-participant design is more appropriate because
                 exposure to one condition is likely to have a systematic and undesirable
                 influence on performance in another condition.</p>

            <h2>Mixed (between-and-within participant) design</h2>
              <p>In a mixed design, some independent variables are manipulated
                within participant and some variables are manipulated between participant.</p>

              <p>Finally, note that design questions similar to those that we have
                discussed here for participants can also come up with regard to
                items. In that case, we talk of within-item, between-item, and
                mixed (item) designs.</p>
