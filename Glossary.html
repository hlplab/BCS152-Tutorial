  <div class="jumbotron R top">
      <a id="A"><h1>A</h1></a>
      <span class="word">Accuracy:</span> The number or percentage of correct responses by a participant (e.g. on a <a href="#L">lexical decision task</a>)<br>
      <span class="word">Amazon Mechanical Turk:</span> Online platform where researchers can post short experiments and tasks for workers (participants) to complete <br>
      <span class="word">Answer:</span>The response that is made to a stimulus item during an experiment. Different experimental methods involve different types of answers. For example, in a <a href="#W">word-by-word self-paced reading experiment</a>, a written sentence is presented on a computer screen one word a time. Participants read each word and then press a button to see the next word in the sentence. In this case, the *answer* is a simple button press indicating that the participant has read the stimulus word on screen. Other experimental methods involve more complex answer (or response) formats. For example, in a categorization task, participants might see/hear a stimulus item and then respond by pressing either button A, B or C to indicate that the stimulus belongs to Category X, Y or Z, respectively.  <br>
      <span class="word">Answer Response Time:</span>The amount of time it takes to respond to a stimulus item during an experiment. Response times are often measured as the total number of milliseconds from when a target stimulus item was presented (i.e., stimulus onset) to when a valid response/answer was made. (For discussion of valid responses, see answer above) <br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron A">
    <a id="B"><h1>B</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Baseline condition:</span> Condition that measures the outcome variable given some assumed basline value of the predictor variable that is compared to the experimentally manipulated value of the predictor variable. <br>
    <span class="word">Between-participants design:</span> Participants are divided into different groups (e.g. <a href="#C">Control group</a>, <a href="#E">Experimental Group</a>). Groups are compared to other groups in the analysis.<br>
    <span class="word">Bi-syllabic</span> A word composed of exactly two syllables. E.g., 'ego' and 'toothpaste' are both bi-syllabic words.<br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron I">
    <a id="C"><h1>C</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Categorical Variable:</span> Variable that can only take on a fixed set of values. For instance, color (red, blue, green) is a categorical variable. Compare to <a href="#I">Continuous variable</a>. <br>
    <span class="word">Clauses:</span>A group of words that contains a subject and predicate. A clause can form a complete sentence, or part of a sentence. For instance, in the sentence, "Mary saw the man", the clause is the entire sentence. However, "Mary saw the man, who was wearing the red hat" contains two clauses (underlined). Clauses that can stand alone as a complete sentence on their own ("Mary saw the man") are known as independent/main clauses. Clauses that cannot stand alone ("who was wearing the red hat") are dependent/subordinate clauses.  <br>
    <span class="word">Comma Separated Value Format (CSV format):</span> Plain text document format in which columns of data are separated by a comma (or other delimiter, such as a tab). Very computer-friendly. You can create one of these files by saving as csv in Excel. <br>
    <span class="word">Comprehension Question:</span> Comprehension questions provide a measure of whether participants are paying attention during an experiment (i.e. in self-paced reading, ensures that they are reading the sentence, as opposed to just clicking to get through it as quickly as possible). Comprehension questions can be asked after every sentence, block of sentences, or even at the end of the experiment (depending on the type of experiment).<br>
    <span class="word">Confidence Interval:</span> Measure of how well the <a href="#S">sample</a> statistic (e.g. the mean heights of a group of randomly selected students) approximates the actual population statistic (e.g. the actual mean heights of students if we had access to the entire population). Provides a range of values that the statistic should fall in between x% of time, depending on the confidence level. E.g. A confidence level of 95% means that if we sample from the same population numerous times, the true value of the statistic we are interested in should fall within the confidence interval in ~95% of cases.  <br>
    <span class="word">Confound:</span>  Something in the experiment that a) affects the results (i.e., is correlated with the <a href="#O">outcome variable)</a> and b) is correlated with the <a href="#P">predictor variables</a>. E.g. if we want to examine the effect word length has on reading time (e.g., two vs three syllable nouns), we should make sure to control for word <a href="#F">frequency</a>, since a) frequency strongly affects reading times (Rayner et al. 1989) and b) longer words tend to be less frequent than shorter words (Zipf 1949). <br>
    <span class="word">Continuous Variable:</span>Variable that can take on any value between two values. E.g. height is a continuous variable because people can be any height within a certain range. Compare to <a href="#D">discrete variable</a>.<br>
    <span class="word">Control group:</span> The group of participants that serves as a point of comparison for the experimental group. For example, in a clinical trial to test the efficacy of a new drug, the experimental group would receive the drug while the control group might receive a sugar pill instead. <br>
    <span class="word">Control variable:</span> Factors that are held constant in the experiment. For example, if we want to find out how sunlight affects plant growth, we would want to make sure all the plants receive the same amount of water and fertilizer, so that these factors will not affect our results. <br>
    <span class="word">Corpus:</span> A collection of written text<br>
    <span class="word">Critical Item:</span> Item in the experiment that you are interested in (contrast with <a href="#F">Filler Item</a>).
    <span class="word">Critical Region:</span> In self-paced reading, the critical region of the sentence refers to part of the sentence where your experimental manipulation occurs. For instance, say you are interested in how reading times are affected by semantic predictability. Your stimuli might include sentences such as "Florian ate the chocolate yesterday" (high predictability) vs "Florian ate the table yesterday" (low predictability). The critical region occurs when chocolate/table is read.

  <div class="jumbotron N">
    <a id="D"><h1>D</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Dependent Variable:</span> The variable that responds to the change made in the independent variable; this is the quantity or value that is being measured. For example, to test how sunlight affects plant growth, a researcher might vary the amount of sunlight (independent variable) different plants receive. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable because it <em>depends</em> on the independent variable. <br>

        <span class="word">Filler Item:</span> Items in the list that are used to make the participant unaware of what the experimenter is testing. E.g. If we are interested in reaction times to Sentence Structure A, we might also want to include some stimuli that are of Sentence Structure B. <br>
        <span class="word">Frequency:</span> Number of times a word occurs in the lexicon, usually as measured within some <a href="#C">corpus</a>.

Plotting these residuals can help you determine whether the particular type of model was a good fit for the data. <br>

  <div class="jumbotron R">
    <a id="S"><h1>S</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Sample:</span> A collection of data drawn from the population. E.g. if we want to study language development in two-year-olds, we will draw a sample from the entire <a href="#P">population</a> of two-year olds.

    <span class="word">Self-paced Reading (SPR):</span> Experimental paradigm in which words of a sentence are displayed one by one in response to the participant's actions (e.g. pressing a space bar on the computer). <br>
