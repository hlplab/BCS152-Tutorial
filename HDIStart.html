        <h1>How Do I Start?</h1>

          <p>
            Let's get started. This section talks about how to choose a topic/question for
            your research and how to go from that question to a hypothesis that is sufficiently
            constrained so that it can be tested in an experiment.
          </p>

        <h2>How to pick a a question</h2>

        <p>
          Perhaps you already know a topic that you're interested in? But let's say you don't.
          How do you get started? Think about your interests within
          the class and topics you want to explore further. Was their a section in the textbook,
          or another reading or lecture that pique your interest? Perhaps you remember reading
          or hearing about a news story about some cool language research? If you're drawing a
          blank on all of these, no problem: Perhaps try a brainstorm session with some friends.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you have a vague idea of what type of topic your interested in, the next step is to
          get a bit more background in that topic. Have a look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics" target="_blank">
          Wikipedia</a>. Read a paper or two, think about your topic critically, and see what aspect of your topic you would
          want to expand on. You can find papers by looking into your textbook
          or by using the <a href="http://scholar.google.com.ezp.lib.rochester.edu" target="_blank">
          University of Rochester's Google Scholar interface</a>. At this stage, you don't need
          to read the papers in depth. Instead, we recommend you focus on the types of questions
          the papers address. In reading them, start to think about how a project of yours could
          contribute this line of work. Often, a first step is to <a href="Glossary.html#R" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">replicate</a> a
          finding that hasn't been replicated before (or not to your satisfaction). Replications
          are critical to scientific progress, as they help us to distinguish reliable results
          (which our theories need to cover) from unreliable results.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you continue further, do a little bit of research on how contemporary
          your question is. Has this question already been decisively answered? Have researchers'
          views on this question changed a lot since the question was first formulated? Let's say
          that you've found an interesting paper&mdash;perhaps a classic study. You
          can use Google Scholar (linked above) to restrict your search to only those papers
          that cite the classic article. You can also restrict the publication date of the papers
          you're interested in to be relatively recent.

      <h2>From question to hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          After you have a question you want to address, you need to formulate a hypothesis
          to answer these questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hypothesis is a statement about the world&mdash;in our case, about the brain/mind&mdash;that we seek to test. This can
          be a pretty general idea. For example, we might hypothesize that previous experience shapes how we process
          language. In order to test a hypothesis, we need to derive testable predictions from it. This might require further clarifying and specifying the hypothesis.
          For example, a more specific version of the hypothesis is that we have less difficulty
          processing words that have higher
          <a href="Glossary.html#R" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">relative frequency</a>.
          Note that this hypothesis&mdash;like many good hypotheses&mdash;is describing a <em>causal</em> relationship. This hypothesis
          still leaves a lot open for interpretation: for example, it doesn't specify <em>why</em> relative frequency
          is hypothesized to cause faster processing or <em>how</em>, precisely, this effect would come about. But for the
          current purpose that's ok.
        </p>

        <h2>From hypothesis to prediction</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we have a sufficiently specific hypothesis, we can derive predictions from it. Predictions
            describe a predicted relation between
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">predictor variables</a>
            (also called <a href="Glossary.html#I" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">independent variables</a>)
            and <a href="Glossary.html#O" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">outcome variables</a>
            (also called <a href="Glossary.html#D" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">dependent variables</a>).
            In the simplest case, a prediction relates one predictor to one outcome variable.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, we might predict that words with higher relative frequency counts will be <em>read</em> faster
            during sentence processing. In this case, relative frequency is the predictor variable and reading times on
            the target word are the outcome variable. Note that this prediction is yet more specific than the hypothesis
            described above. For example, it is a statement about reading speed, rather than the more general concept of
            processing difficulty (which applies to listening, too, and which could also be measured in terms of the accuracy
            of word recognition, rather than the speed of word recognition).
          </p>

          <p>
            Later we will see that designing an experiment will often require us to make even more specific assumptions then
            described in this prediction. For example, we typically have to <em>estimate</em> the predictor variables
            hypothesized to affect the outcome, and, of course, we have to <em>measure</em> the outcome. But for now, you
            should know enough to get started on thinking about a research question, hypothesis, and prediction.
