        <h2>Avoiding confounds</h2>
          <p>
            Recall how we said that we should try to
            <a href="Glossary.html#B" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">balance</a>
            all differences between (the critical items in the different) conditions,
            <em>except</em> for the differences that are intended by our manipulation?
          </p>

          <p>
            This is worth stressing again, because it is very important. If our
            manipulations (i.e., our conditions) are confounded with other differences
            that plausibly could affect our outcome variable (reading times), then
            we won't be able to draw reliable conclusions from our experiment.
          </p>

          <p>
            As already discussed, this means that we need to either hold constant
            (within any critical item) or at least balance (across all critical
            items) any differences across conditions. Have a look at
            the example critical item in Figure 1. Think of some
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">plausible confounds</a>?
            Are they held constant within this item? After you've thought
            a bit about this read on.
          </p>

          <p> Recall the 2x2 example design we described earlier:</p>
          <figure>
            <img title="Example 2x2 Design" alt="Example 2x2 Design" src="Example.png">
            <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: A 2x2 design, crossing contextual predictability (high vs. low) with word frequency (high vs. low).</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br>

          <p>The example item above holds many properties that we are not interested in
            constant between conditions. For example, in order to manipulate contextual
            predictability, the item is manipulating the verb ("ate" vs. "saw"). Can you
            think of a reason why we didn't use "devoured" instead of "ate"? "Devoured"
            is much longer than "saw", whereas both "ate" and "saw" are
            <a href="Glossary.html#M" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">mono-syllabic</a>.
            Both verbs also have exactly three letters. Word length is a strong
            predictor of reading times, with longer words taking longer to read.
            Another reason why we don't want to use "devoured" is that "devoured"
            is much less frequent than "saw". Like word length, word frequency
            might affect reading times--as a matter of fact that's one of the hypotheses
            we are testing! But we are testing this hypothesis for the words "apple" vs.
            "kiwi", so we don't want another region in the sentence that might create
            an additional frequency effect. Failing to do so would mean that the
            effects blend together (processing difficulty with a word often
            <a href="Glossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Spill-over means that the processing difficulty associated with a word leads to slower reading times on the immediately subsequent words.">spills over</a>),
            which might make them harder to tease apart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that similar, though slightly different, considerations apply to
            "apple" and "kiwi". For example, both words are
            <a href="Glossary.html#B" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">bi-syllabic</a>.
            They do differ in frequency, but that's ok: That's one of our <em>
            intended</em> manipulations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The example item also holds constant between conditions many other variables
            known to affect reading times. For example, the target word is always
            equally far away from the sentence start and sentence end. Reading times
            are known to speed up throughout sentences, but then slow down at the
            boundary of
            <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">clauses</a> or
            <a href="Glossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">sentences</a>,
            as well as at line breaks, paragraph breaks, etc. The example item also
            holds constant the syntactic structure (and with it syntactic complexity,
            locality, etc.) and the position of the target word relative to that structure.
            All of these properties make this example item a good item.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are many advantages to creating items that hold many properties
            constant. Any property that is held constant <em>within</em> all item
            is also automatically balanced <em>across</em> all items!
          </p>

          <p>
            Still there are a few properties that are not held constant. For example,
            "saw" and "ate" might differ slighlty in frequency
            (feel free to <a href="Resources.html#A">look up their frequency</a>).
            This is the type of difference that we might want to try to
            <a href="Glossary.html#B" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">balance</a>
            across items.
          </p>

          <p id="beyond">
            There are many many other differences between the conditions of the example
            critical item, but we
            only care about those that are
            <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">plausible confounds</a>.
            For example, "apple" and "kiwi" differ in more subtle aspects of their phonological structure.
            Whereas "apple" consists of a VCVC (vowel-consonant-vowel-consontant)
            sequence, "kiwi" consists of a CVCV sequence.
            It is theoretically possible that this affects reading times.
            But we won't worry about that because we have no reason to believe that
            this difference will have a particular large effect, if it has any
            effect at all.

          <h2>Beyond confounds</h2>
            <p>
              In designing SPR experiments, researchers often go one step further than
              to just avoid confounds. Recall that it is ok, if properties vary between
              items, as long as it balanced with regard to the conditions. In fact a
              little bit of variability across
              items is good in that it makes the sentences less predictable and less
              monotonous.
            </p>

            <p id="fwfnl">
              On the other hand, we also don't want the different critical items to
              be completely different. The idea behind this is that one doesn't want
              to swamp the effect of interest in other differences between items that
              might cause much larger differences in readings. For this reason,
              experimenters often make critical items <em>similar to each other</em>.
              For example, we might vary the length the subject in our sentences from
              1 to, say, 3 words. But we might also want to keep all verbs in all
              critical items
              <a href="Glossary.html#T" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">transitive</a>.
              Additionally, it is often a good idea to not have critical items of
              widely varying syntactic complexity or length.

          <h2>A few final considerations for critical items suited for self-paced reading</h2>
            <p>
              There are a few final consideration worth mentioning that are very particular to
              SPR experiments:
            </p>

          <ul>
            <li><em>Line breaks:</em> If at
            all possible, we should avoid line breaks in critical items. If
            necessary, it is best if the sentence region of interest in the critical item is at
            least three words away from the beginning or end of a line.</li>
            <li><em>End of sentence:</em> If at
            all possible, the sentence region of interest should also be at least
            three words before the end of the sentence. The end of the sentence
            is often associated with large increases in reading times (presumably
            because of processes associated with understanding the sentence).</li>
            <li><em>Sentence length:</em> Unless your experiment is targeted at
              the consequences of complex and long sentences or for some other
              reason requires such sentences, it is generally a good idea to keep
              critical items simple (while still fulfilling the other constraints
              mentioned above).</li>
