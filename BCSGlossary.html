  <div class="jumbotron R">
      <a id="A"><h1>A</h1></a>
      <span class="word">Accuracy:</span> The number or percentage of correct responses by a subject (e.g. on a <a href="#L">lexical decision task</a>)<br>
    <span class="word">Amazon Mechanical Turk:</span> Online platform where researchers can post short experiments and tasks for workers (subjects) to complete <br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron A">
    <a id="B"><h1>B</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Baseline condition:</span> Condition that measures the subject's response to the dependent variable before the independent variable is manipulated <br>
    <span class="word">Between-subjects design:</span> Subjects are divided into different groups (e.g. <a href="#C">Control group</a>, <a href="#E">Experimental Group</a>). Groups are compared to other groups in the analysis.<br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron I">
    <a id="C"><h1>C</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Categorical Variable:</span> Variable that can only take on a fixed set of values. For instance, color (red, blue, green) is a categorical variable. <br>
    <span class="word">Comma Separated Value Format (CSV format):</span> Plain text document format in which columns of data are separated by a comma (or other delimiter, such as a tab). Very computer-friendly. You can create one of these files by saving as csv in Excel. <br>
    <span class="word">Confidence Interval:</span> Measure of how well the <a href="#S">sample</a> statistic (e.g. the mean heights of a group of randomly selected students) approximates the actual population statistic (e.g. the actual mean heights of students if we had access to the entire population). Provides a range of values that the statistic should fall in between x% of time, depending on the confidence level. E.g. A confidence level of 95% means that if we sample from the same population numerous times, the true value of the statistic we are interested in should fall within the confidence interval in ~95% of cases.  <br>
    <span class="word">Confound:</span>  Something in the experiment that a) affects the results (i.e., is correlated with the <a href="#D">dependent variable)</a> and b) is correlated with the <a href="#I">independent variables</a>. E.g. if we want to examine the effect word length has on reading time (e.g., two vs three syllable nouns), we should make sure to control for word <a href="#F">frequency</a>, since a) frequency strongly affects reading times (Rayner et al. 1989) and b) longer words tend to be less frequent than shorter words (Zipf 1949). <br>

    <span class="word">Continuous Variable:</span>Variable that can take on any value between two values. E.g. height is a continuous variable because people can be any height within a certain range. Compare to <a href="#D">discrete variable</a>.<br>
    <span class="word">Control group:</span> The group of subjects that serves as a point of comparison for the experimental group. For example, in a clinical trial to test the efficacy of a new drug, the experimental group would receive the drug while the control group might receive a sugar pill instead. <br>
    <span class="word">Control variable:</span> Factors that are held constant in the experiment. For example, if we want to find out how sunlight affects plant growth, we would want to make sure all the plants receive the same amount of water and fertilizer, so that these factors will not affect our results. <br> 
    <span class="word">Corpus:</span> A collection of written text<br>
    <span class="word">Critical Item:</span> Item in the experiment that you are interested in (contrast with <a href="#F">Filler Item</a>).

  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron N">
    <a id="D"><h1>D</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Dependent Variable:</span> The variable that responds to the change made in the independent variable; this is the quantity or value that is being measured. For example, to test how sunlight affects plant growth, a researcher might vary the amount of sunlight (independent variable) different plants receive. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable because it <em>depends</em> on the independent variable.<br>
    <span class="word">Discrete Variable:</span> Variable that can only take on a finite number of values within a range. For instance, number of chairs in a room is a discrete variable, as you much have a whole number of chairs. Compare to <a href="#I">Continuous variable</a>.<br>
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron B">
    <a id="E"><h1>E</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Excel Format (XLSX):</span> Document format created by Microsoft Excel. <br>

    <span class="word">Eyetracker:</span> Technology used to measure the position of where the subject is looking in real-time. 
  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron O">
    <a id="F"><h1>F</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Factoral Design:</span> An experiment with two or more <a href="#I">Independent Variables</a>. E.g. in a 2x2 factorial design, there are two independent vriables and one dependent variable.<br>
    <span class="word">Filler Item:</span> Items in the list that are used to make the subject unaware of what the experimenter is testing. E.g. If we are interested in reaction times to Sentence Structure A, we might also want to include some stimuli that are of Sentence Structure B. <br>
    <span class="word">Frequency:</span> Number of times a word occurs in the lexicon, usually as measured within some <a href="#C">corpus</a>.

  </div>

  <div class="jumbotron I">
    <a id="I"><h1>I</h1></a>
    <span class="word">Independent Variable:</span> The part of the experiment that is changed by the researcher. For example, to test how sunlight affects plant growth, a researcher might vary the amount of sunlight (independent variable) different plants receive. The growth of the plants is the dependent variable because it <em>depends</em> on the independent variable.<br>
    <span class="word">Iteraction:</span> When two or more <a href="#I">independent variables</a> affect the <a href="#D">dependent variable </a>in a way that is non-additive. E.g.

    <span class="word">Neighborhood Density:</span> A measure of how many words sound similar to the word in question. E.g. "cat" and "mat" are phonological neighbors. Words with many such neighbors have a high neighborhood density.<br>

    <span class="word">Replicate:</span> To repeat an experiment in the same or similar conditions <br>
    <span class="word">Residual:</span> After fitting a model (e.g. linear regression) to the data, the residual of each observed value is equal to the difference between the observed value and what the model predicts at that value.
