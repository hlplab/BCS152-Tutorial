        <h1>Design</h1>
          <p>
            Once you have a research question, hypothesis, and prediction, the next step is
            to develop the experimental design. In this section, we talk about the basics of
            experimental design, participants, and items.
          </p>


        <h2>Operationalizing a design</h2>
          <p>
            Experimental design is the means by which hypotheses are operationalized.
             In other words, experimental design is how you collect controlled observations
              (i.e., data) about the relationship among the variables of interest. Note that
            our hypotheses often involve predictors that are
            <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">continuous variables</a>.
            The predictor variable we've discussed on the previous page&mdash;the relative frequency
            of words&mdash;is an example of a continuous predictor. For the purpose of experimental
            designs, continuous predictors are often <em>binned</em> into a small number of bins
            (though this is not always desirable, it is a common convention and for the current
            purpose, it will make it easier to talk about the design options you have for your
            experiment). Binning turns continuous variables into
            <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">categorical variables</a>.
            For example, we might bin words based on their relative frequency into "high" and "low"
            frequency words.
          </p>

          <p>
            There are also variables that are naturally considered categorical. For example, if
            we hypothesized that nouns are read more quickly than verbs, "noun" vs. "verb" would
            be a categorical predictor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just like predictors, outcomes can be continuous or categorical. Reading times are an
            example of a continous outcome. The accuracy of an answer to a comprehension question
            (which is either true or false) is an example of a categorical outcome.
          </p>

        <h2>Conditions</h2>
          <p>
            The first step in experimental design is to specify the conditions
            (e.g., test conditions and control conditions) that allow you to test
            your hypothesis. The conditions describe how we plan to manipulate
            our <a href="Glossary.html#P" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">predictor variables</a>.
            The goal of this manipulation is to test whether we will observe the
            change in the <a href="Glossary.html#O" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">outcome variables</a>
            predicted by our hypothesis.
          </p>

          <p>
            To continue the example introduced above, consider that we plan to bin
            relative frequency into "high" and "low" frequency words. We would then
            design our experiment to have a high-frequency condition and a low-frequency
            condition. <b>Our prediction would be that reading times will be faster in
            the high-frequency condition than in the low-frequency condition.</b>
          </p>

          <p>
            Without further additions, we would call this a <b>by-2 design</b>, because we
            have one predictor variable in two conditions and there are no other
            manipulations in the experiment. We will go through a more detailed example
            in later pages, but first we'll establish a little bit more terminology.
