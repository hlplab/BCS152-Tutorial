        <h1>Interpretation</h1>
          <p>Once your data has been collected, it's time to begin the important
          and often harrowing task of interpretation. </p>
        <h3>Predictions</h3>
          <p>It is always a good practice before interpreting a pattern of data to
          clearly articulate your predictions for each dependent measure and their
          interactions. These should already have been established long before data
          was even collected, but it is important to revisit them before thinking
          about whether your data can be argued to support them.</p>
        <h3>Exclusions</h3>
          <p>Another critical step prior to evaluating data is determining whether
            any of it needs to be excluded from interpretation. Measurements of
            human behaviors are often noisy, and language processing is no
            exception to this. A number of externalities can occur that make data
            difficult or impossible to interpret. Participants can be distracted
            by the environment, their cell phone, or their own thoughts, potentially
            leading them to abandon the task in the middle of a trial. It makes
            sense to exclude such instances, since they could bias results in a way
            that doesn't actually reflect the processing measure of interest. In
            doing this, it is VERY important to set explicit criteria for the
            exclusion of data BEFORE doing any interpretation. Otherwise, you risk
            falling into a very dangerous pattern of sculpting your data to fit your
            desired outcome. </p>
          <p>Typically, any trials with reading times that exceed a certain threshold
            (typically RTS above 2.5 standard deviations) can be excluded from the
            final analysis, since they are likely not reflective of langugae processing.
            These are usually referred to as outliers.</p>
          <h3>Comprehension Questions</h3>
            <p>Each trial in your study should also have been paired with a comprehension
              question. These are an important tool for assessing whether the
              participant really processed the content of the trial as well as a
              built-in check on the quality of your materials. For example, it
              is typical to exclude from analysis  items whose comprehension
              questions were answered incorrectly. Although it is unlikely if your
              items were well designed, you may also consider the cross-subject
              accuracy and exclude items for which the comprehension questions
              were often incorrect. This could indicate that a particular item
              was exceptionally confusing or difficult to interpret. In some cases,
              the participant's accuracy can also be a dependent measure of
              interest in its own right. This will depend on your particular
              hypotheses.</p>
            <p>Under some circumstances, it might make sense to enclude an entire
              participant, if for example, they answered fewer than 80% of the
              comprehension questions correctly or a large proportion of their
              trials had to be excluded due to outlier RTs. It is again a good
              practice to establish exclusion criteria based on established
              practices in the literature before evaluating at the data.</p>
          <h3>Reading Time</h3>
            <p>Our primary measure of interest is reading time (RT). It can become
              somewhat counterintutive when we start linking reading times to
              processing speed, so it's important to remember that higher reading
              times map onto interference, or slower processing. Lower reading
              times mean faster processing.</p>
            <p>Returning to our ongoing example experiment, let's first consider
              what our predictions are. Our 2x2 design means that we need to
              consider the main effect of each of our two independent variables,
              as well as their interaction.</p>
            <p>Recall that in the restrictive condition, there is a smaller
              hypothesis space for upcoming words, leading to stronger predictions,
              which we assume facilitates processing. So, we expect that our
              reading times should be lower in the restrictive condition than
              in the non-restrictive. </p>
            <p>We also predicted that reading times for high frequency items will
              be lower than for low frequency items. </p>
            <p>What about the interaction between these conditions?</p>
            <p>We predicted that the effect of frequency should be weaker in the
              restrictive condition. One explanation for this effect would be
              that the smaller space of hypothetical upcoming words in the
              restrictive condition . Predictions are much stronger, and the
              effects of lexical frequency is diminished.</p>
