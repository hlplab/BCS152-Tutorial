          <h1>Self Paced Reading Example: Design</h1>
          <p>In this section, we expand on the example experiment we've introduced
            above, which manipulated word frequency. We extend this example of a by-2
            design to 2x2 design.</p>

          <p>But first things first. We'll follow the guidelines described so far
            and begin by outlining a research hypothesis that we want to test.</p>


          <h2>Working hypothesis</h2>
          <p>For this example experiment, we start with the hypothesis that language
            processing is
            <a href="Glossary.html#E" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">expectation-based</a>.
            That is, we hypothesize that
            <a href="Glossary.html#C" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">comprehenders</a>
            automatically draw on implicit statistical knowledge about the distribution
            of linguistic elements while processing language. Although we will not
            further focus on it this year, this hypothesis is in turn derived from a
            more general theory&mdash;namely, that the brain makes rational
            use of available information to robustly and efficiently infer linguistic
            structure (and thereby sentence interpretations) from noisy perceptual
            input.</p>

          <p>To operationalize this hypothesis, we will narrow it down further.
            Specifically, we plan to test whether expectations about upcoming
            <em>words</em> affect how fast these words are <em>read</em>. That is,
            we are testing the expectation-based hypothesis with regard to expectations
            about words while using reading (rather than, for instance, listening or
            viewing sign language) as the mode in which language is presented.</p>

          <p>If the expecation-based hypothesis is correct, words that are more expected
            should be read more quickly and words that are less expected will be read
            more slowly. It is also possible that some of the effects of processing
            difficulty due to a word's expectedness will
            <a href="Glossary.html#S" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Spill-over means that the processing difficulty associated with a word leads to slower reading times on the immediately subsequent words.">spill over</a>,
            thus affecting the reading times of subsequent words. With this in
            mind, we are now ready to describe the design we will use to test
            this prediction.</p>


          <h2>A 2x2 Example Design</h2>
          <p>We will test our working hypothesis in a 2x2 design, by crossing word
            frequency (high vs. low frequency) with contextual predictability (high
            vs. low predictability). This design is illustrated by Figure 1, which
            shows an example of a critical item in its four (2x2) conditions.</p>
            <figure>
              <img title="Example 2x2 Design" alt="Example 2x2 Design" src="Example.png">
              <figcaption style="text-align:center;">Figure 1: A 2x2 design, crossing contextual predictability (high vs. low) with word frequency (high vs. low).</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <br>

          <p>This design allows us to test the expectation-based hypothesis in two ways.
            First, if a word is in a high predictability context (e.g., "apple" or
            "kiwi" after the verb "ate") then it should be read more quickly.
            Second, if a word is in a low predictability context (e.g., after the
            verb "saw"), then more frequent words (e.g., "apple") should be read
            more quickly than low frequency words (e.g., "kiwi").</p>

          <p>That is, we might predict contextual predictability and word frequency to
            <a href="Glossary.html#I" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">interact</a>,
            with frequency effects being larger (or even only present) in the low
            predictability condition. Alternatively,
            we might find that contextual predictability and word frequency have
            independent additive effects on reading times.</p>

          <h2>Within- or Between-?</h2>
          <p>The design in Figure 1 is an example of a within-item design: across
            participants, each critical item occurs in all conditions (this does
            not mean that every single participant sees each item in all of its
            conditions; more on that below).</p>

          <p>With regard to participants, we could conduct the experiment as within-
            or between-participant design. For now, we will assume that we will
            take the simplest option and make the design within-participant.</p>

          <p>Of course, we don't want to run an experiment with just one item.
            As we've discussed above, that wouldn't let us generalize from whatever
            we find in our experiments to how people process language more generally.
            Instead, our experiment will have many items, all of them following
            the same structure of the example item shown in Figure 1. In the
            following sections, we will cover more details about items and then
            go through how we can construct lists of items for our experiment.</p>
