        <h1>A Little About This Tutorial</h1>

        <p>This tutorial is aimed to teach you how to design and create your own
          experiment. We will be using general information about basic experimental design
          and how to use <a href="https://www.hlp.rochester.edu/CrowdExp/" target="_blank" class="bldxtrnl">CrowdExp(eriment)</a>,
          software that has been created by the
          <a href="https://www.hlp.rochester.edu/" target="_blank" class="bldxtrnl">Human Language Processing (HLP) lab</a>
          in order to run experiments over the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          The navigation bar at the top of this page is set up so that you can
          reference back to any section that you need.
          While this tutorial is meant to introduce the most important
          general concepts required to conduct experiments on language processing,
          the primary goal of the tutorial is to help you prepare a
          <a href="SPRProcedure.html" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Here's a demonstration of self-paced reading">self-paced reading
          experiment (SPR)</a> via CrowdExp. To help you with this, the tutorial goes
          through a specific example of an SPR experiment. The buttons on the bottom on the screen will
          indicate when you are moving on the a general or SPR section of the tutorial by blue and yellow buttons
          respectively. The SPR specific and general section pages will also be
          colored the respective yellow and blue colors.
        </p>

        <p>
          After each section of the tutorial, there is an optional quiz. We highly
          recommend you take these quizzes. They will test your understanding of
          what you read and will guide you through the materials you
          do not understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any items that are highlighted in red, you can hover over them and text will
          <a href="Glossary.html#A" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hey look some text!!">appear</a>.
          If you click on the link it will take you to the term on the glossary page. Go ahead, try it.
          There are several other links. Purple superscript links will link to a paper <a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2011/10/17/0956797611417632" class="sup">[Paper]</a>.
          <!--There are internal links, so a link that is <a href="Design.html" class="bldgn">[blue]</a> will link to an internal page
          of a general topic while a link that is <a href="SPRProcedure.html" class="bldspr">[yellow]</a> will link to an internal page
          of a topic specific to self paced reading.--> A link that is <a href="#" class="bldxtrnl">[grey]</a> will link to an external page.
        </p>

        <p>
          After you have completed this tutorial, you will be ready to use what you have learned
          here and in class to then create your own experiment. This could be
          an idea you just want to test or a replication study based on readings
          you have done.
        </p>

        <p>
          One final note before we continue. This tutorial, at times, goes into a lot
          of detail (for example, when we discuss possible problems with experiments).
          This is all meant to help you create the best experiment possible. But
          we also recognize that the first step is the hardest. So, when it all gets
          too much, feel free to simplify your experiment. Keeping it simple is often a
          good idea anyway =).
