        <h1>A Little About This Tutorial</h1>

        <p>This tutorial is aimed to teach you how to design and create your own
          experiment. We will be using general information about basic experimental design
          and how to use <a href="https://www.hlp.rochester.edu/CrowdExp/" target="_blank">CrowdExp(eriment)</a>,
          software that has been created through the
          <a href="https://www.hlp.rochester.edu/" target="_blank">Human Language Processing (HLP) lab</a>
          in order to run experiments over the web.
        </p>

        <p>
          The navigation bar at the top of this page is set up so that you can
          reference back any section
          that you need. While this tutorial is meant to introduce the most important
          general concepts required to conduct experiments on language processing,
          the primary goal of the tutorial is to help you prepare a
          <a href="Glossary.html#A" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="">self-paced reading
          experiment (SPR)</a> via CrowdExp. To help you with this, the tutorial goes
          through a specific example of an SPR experiment. Both in the top menu and
          in the navigation bar the bottom of this page, the
          SPR specific topics are highlighted in yellow and the general topics in blue.
          The sections will also be colored the respective yellow and blue colors on each page
          for the SPR specific and general topics.
        </p>

        <p>
          After each section of the tutorial, there is an optional quiz. We highly
          recommend you take these quizzes. They will test to make sure you understand
          what you read, but will also be able to guide you through the materials you
          do not understand.
        </p>

        <p>
          For any items that are highlighted you can hover over them and text will
          <a href="Glossary.html#A" target="_blank" class="red" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Hey look some text!!">appear</a>.
          If you click on the link it will take you to the term on the glossary page. Go ahead, try it.
          (this differs from the blue links, which open another website in a new
          browser window.)
        </p>

        <p>
          After you have completed this tutorial, you will be ready to use what you have learned
          here and in class. You can then create your own experiment. This could be
          an idea you just want to test or a replication study based on readings
          you have done.
        </p>

        <p>
          One final note before we continue. This tutorial at times goes into a lot
          of detail, for example, when we discuss possible problems with experiments.
          This is all meant to help you create the best experiment possible. But
          we also recognize that the first step is the hardest. So, when it all gets
          too much, feel free to simplify your experiment. Keeping it simple is often a
          good idea anyway =).
